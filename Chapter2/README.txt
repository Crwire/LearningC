Statements I: input, assignment, output

Output with printf()
Using the % output or input types:
%d integer
%f float
%c char
%s string (I guessed)

Input with scanf(%d, i);

You can use multiple data types (input/output) but be careful with the order that you use them in. Also, mixing datatypes is okay but the output may be different than what you want/expect!
